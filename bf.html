		<p>Bee Friendly is a multi-player game played over several days with players taking one action per day.</p>
		<p>AIM: Finish the game with the most VICTORBEE POINTS</p>
		
	</div>
	</br>
	
	<div class="rules">
		At the beginning of each bee-day, a bee-board is generated.  Each player is a Queen and has TWO WORKER BEES and ONE STINGER BEE. 
	</br>
	</br>
		</br>
		Each queen decides where in the honeycomb to place her BEEs (secretly submitting).  Players have a day to decide on their moves.  When placing a STINGER BEE, a direction (N,S,E or W) is also chosen.
</br>
</br>
</br>
		At the end of the day, once all BEEs have been placed, the following happens:
		</br>
		</br>
		
		-The positions of all BEEs are revealed
		</br>
		</br>
		-Each STINGER BEE stings all bees in the chosen directions (this removes them from the board.)  Each opposing BEE stung is worth one VICTORBEE POINT.  If you sting your own BEE, you lose 1 VICTORBEE POINT.
		</br>
		</br>
		-Every BEE on the board has its score calculated based on the rules of the square occupied.
</br>
</br>
</br>
		Here is an example board:

		</br>
		An example move for this board is:
		</br>
		</br>
		
		-STINGER A2 (stinging North)
		</br>
		-WORKER E1
		</br>
		-WORKER E4
